# Work Day Scheduler (Homework 5)
This web application is a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day after entering text in a time slot and clicking a save button. Additionally, time slots are color-coded to indicate whether a given slot is in the present (red), future (green), or past (gray).
